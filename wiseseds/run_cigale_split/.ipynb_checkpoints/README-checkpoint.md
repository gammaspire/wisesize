These scripts will run CIGALE separately on the North and South hemisphere galaxies. The computation time is around 2x that of the updated versions in the parent directory.

Also identical to the updated versions of my wrappers, to run (after navigating to this directory locally):
```
conda activate cigale
python run_cigale_NS.py -params params.txt'
```
